## 📌 What this project is (and isn’t)

**This is:** a performance tuning helper (system + game-side tweaks, safe defaults, reversible actions).  
**This is NOT:** cheats, aim assist, wallhack, injector, bypass, or anything that modifies game integrity.

If you’re unsure whether a tweak is allowed — don’t enable it.
